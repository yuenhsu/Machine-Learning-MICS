# Machine-Learning-MICS
Machine learning project with MICS microdata in R


## Overview

The purpose of the repository is to demonstrate how to use `caret` to build classification models. This document contains the scripts for machine learning models that aim to predict the use of contraception in Thailand, Laos, and Mongolia with data from the [Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)](https://mics.unicef.org/about) of the UNICEF. The datasets are individual survey responses, and user registrations are required to access the microdata. Therefore, the data are not included in this repository.

The goal is to predict `use`, a binary variable that indicates whether a women of reproductive age is currently using contraception. The project report is available [here](https://yuenhsu.medium.com/predicting-contraception-use-in-asia-with-machine-learning-algorithms-d6bfab783e8).
